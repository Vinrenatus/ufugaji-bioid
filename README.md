# 🐄 Ufugaji-BioID: Livestock Muzzle Print Biometrics System

**KSEF 2026 | Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence / Computer Systems**

A cutting-edge livestock identification system that uses AI-powered muzzle print biometrics to combat cattle rustling in Kenya's ASAL regions.

---

## 🏆 Why This Project Will Win

### Unique Kenyan Context
- **Problem**: Cattle rustling causes death, poverty, and instability in Turkana, Pokot, Kajiado, and other ASAL regions
- **Current Solutions Fail**: Ear tags are cut off, hot iron branding is cruel and damages hides
- **Our Solution**: A cow's muzzle print is unique (like a human fingerprint) and cannot be altered

### Scientific Novelty
- Uses **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** concepts for feature extraction
- Implements **CLAHE** (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for image enhancement
- **Cosine Similarity** algorithm for biometric matching
- **16-dimensional feature vectors** for each muzzle print

### Cross-Cutting Appeal
- ✅ **Computer Science**: AI algorithms, image processing, database design
- ✅ **Agriculture**: Livestock management, rural development
- ✅ **National Cohesion**: Security, conflict resolution, economic stability

### Feasibility
- Works **100% offline** - no internet required
- Runs on standard Android smartphones
- Uses lightweight algorithms suitable for mobile devices

## 🧪 Demo Instructions for Judges

### Setup (Before Presentation)
1. Open the application in a browser
2. Ensure camera permissions are granted
3. Have 3 printed photos of different cow muzzle prints ready ("Dummy Cows")

### Live Demo Flow

#### Step 1: Show the Problem (1 minute)
- Navigate to Home page
- Explain cattle rustling problem in ASAL regions
- Point out why current methods fail

#### Step 2: Enroll Test Cattle (2 minutes)
- Go to "Enroll" page
- Register "Cow A" with sample data:
  - Name: "Kamau's Pride"
  - Owner: "John Kamau"
  - Breed: Boran
  - Location: Kajiado
- Check "Use sample data for demo"
- Click "Enroll Cattle"
- Show the generated certificate

#### Step 3: Test the Matcher (3 minutes) ⭐ **Key Moment**
- Go to "Matcher" page
- Explain the AI algorithm
- **Important**: Since we're using a browser demo:
  - Click "Scan & Match" (uses current camera frame)
  - Show how it compares against database
  - Explain that with actual muzzle photos, it would match Cow A but NOT Cow B or Cow C
- Show match percentage results

#### Step 4: Generate Certificate (1 minute)
- Go to "Registry" page
- Click "Certificate" on enrolled cow
- Click "Download PDF"
- Show the professional certificate

#### Step 5: Offline Capability (1 minute)
- Turn off WiFi/data
- Show app still works
- Demonstrate local storage

## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### Image Processing Pipeline

```
RGB Image → Grayscale → Gaussian Blur → CLAHE → Feature Extraction
```

1. **Grayscale Conversion**
   ```javascript
   gray = 0.299*R + 0.587*G + 0.114*B
   ```

2. **Gaussian Blur** (Noise Reduction)
   - 3x3 kernel convolution
   - Reduces high-frequency noise

3. **CLAHE** (Contrast Enhancement)
   - 8x8 tile grid
   - Clip limit: 2.0
   - Enhances muzzle ridge visibility

4. **Feature Extraction**
   - 4x4 grid division
   - Mean intensity per cell (16 features)
   - Edge density per cell (16 features)
   - Total: 32-dimensional vector (simplified to 16 for demo)

### Matching Algorithm

```javascript
similarity = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
```

- Cosine similarity between feature vectors
- Returns 0-100% match score
- 85%+ = Excellent match
- 70-84% = Good match
- 50-69% = Possible match
